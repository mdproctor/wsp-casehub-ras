# HANDOFF — casehub-ras

**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Issues:** #22 (closed)

## What was done

Cross-repo migration of situation types from desiredstate-api to ras-api (#22).

- **casehub-desiredstate** (`issue-22-move-situation-types` branch, pushed): deleted ActiveSituation, SituationSource, SituationChangeEvent from api/, DefaultSituationSource stub from runtime/. Added ras-api dependency.
- **casehub-ops** (`issue-22-move-situation-types` branch, pushed): updated imports in 4 production + 4 test files. Expanded ActiveSituation (4→8 fields), SituationChangeEvent (1→4 fields), reactive SituationSource (List→Uni). Fixed pre-existing AgentCapability constructor breakage (capabilityVocabulary field added).
- **casehub-ops #6** updated: split into epic casehub-ops#29 with sub-issues #30 (service-as-case modelling) and #31 (operational efficiency). RAS #6 scoped to RAS-specific integration, blocked by ops#30.

## Key decisions

- ChannelDriftChecker migration (qhorus runtime→api Channel types) deferred — deeper than import swaps (Panache entities→records, CSV strings→typed collections). Needs its own issue.
- Service lifecycle epic moved from casehub-ras to casehub-ops — it's a Case/engine concern, not RAS.

## Immediate next step

The ops and desiredstate branches need merging. No remaining ras work — pick from backlog.
